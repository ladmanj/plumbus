Modbus server which is reading data from EcoNET bus of EcoMAX boiler controller.
The modbus part is based on pymodbus server example.
The server part maintains the configuration of the example which it's based on, the boiler data readout configuration is hardcoded unfortunately.
Communication with the boiler uses pyplumio library.
